# Cognitive Pipeline Application

## Description

This is a cross-platform desktop application designed for building and executing "cognitive pipelines." The application provides a user interface for chaining together different processing modules, including interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs) and legacy C libraries. The goal is to create a flexible and extensible tool for complex, multi-step automated tasks.

This project is being developed with the assistance of an AI agent.

## Features

* **Cross-Platform:** Built with C++ and Qt to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Modular Architecture:** A layered design separates the UI, core logic, and backend services.
* **LLM Integration:** Core functionality includes sending prompts to and receiving responses from LLM APIs.
* *(More features to be added)*
