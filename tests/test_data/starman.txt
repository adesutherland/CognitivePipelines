There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus Repeat]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Bridge Section - Narrative Context]
The concept of the Starman is deeply rooted in the Ziggy Stardust mythos. It represents hope, salvation from the stars, and the infinite possibilities of the cosmos arriving to save a dying Earth. The radio signal interrupts the mundane broadcast, a beacon of rock and roll rebellion cutting through the static of a grey reality. It is the moment contact is made, not with a government or a leader, but with the youth, the "children" who are ready to boogie on the ashes of the old world.

[Verse 2 Extension - The Cosmic Connection]
Well, I didn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

[Final Outro Sequence]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Repeat ad infinitum into the fade out, signaling the Starman's departure back into the nebula from whence he came, leaving behind a message of hope and electric blue dreams.)
