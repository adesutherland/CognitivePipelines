### 1. The Entity Extraction Test (Clan Narrative)
**Query:**
> "According to Keltie, why were the MacGregors known as the 'Children of the Mist,' and what was the nature of their proscription?"

**Key Evaluation Criteria (The 'Gold Standard'):**
* **Narrative:** Must explain they were a "broken" and landless clan forced into the wild/inaccessible lands.
* **Victimhood:** Must reference a "war of extermination" by neighbors (Argyll/Breadalbane) and the Government.
* **Legal Status:** Must mention the abolition of their name and the use of bloodhounds to track them.
* **Rob Roy:** Should contextualize Rob Roy as a victim of circumstances, not a born criminal.

### 2. The Terminology & Dates Test (Regimental History)
**Query:**
> "Trace the origin of the 'Black Watch' (42nd Royal Highlanders) as described in the text. What does the Gaelic name 'Am Freiceadan Dubh' signify?"

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**
* **Origin:** Must trace roots to the "Independent Companies" (policing blackmail/cattle theft) prior to becoming a regiment (c. 1729–1740).
* **Etymology:** Must explain the name comes from the **dark color of their tartan** (contrasted with the "Red Soldiers" or *Saighdearan Dearg*).
* **Detail:** References to the specific nature of their duties ("Watching" the Highlands).

### 3. The "Source Fidelity" Test (The Kilt Controversy)
**Query:**
> "Does Keltie support the theory that the kilt is a modern invention? How does he distinguish between the 'Feile-breag' and the 'Feile-beg'?"

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**
* **The Conflict:** **MUST** confirm Keltie supports the theory that the separate kilt (*Feile-beg*) is a modern invention (c. 1728) by an Englishman (Rawlinson).
* **Definitions:**
    * *Feile-breag (Belted Plaid):* Ancient, single piece of cloth, pleated at waist and thrown over shoulder.
    * *Feile-beg (Little Kilt):* Modern, lower part only, separated for industrial convenience.
* **Failure Flag:** If the model claims the separate kilt is ancient (a modern historical correction), the RAG has failed.

### 4. The Academic Debate Test (The Picts)
**Query:**
> "How does Keltie classify the Picts in terms of their racial origin and language? Does he consider them to be of Gothic or Celtic extraction?"

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**
* **Rejection:** Must explicitly **reject** the "Gothic" (Teutonic/Germanic) theory.
* **Evidence:** Must cite **Topography/Place Names** (specifically *Aber* vs *Inver*) or linguistic roots as the primary evidence.
* **Conclusion:** Must classify them as **Celtic**, specifically leaning toward the **Cymric** (Welsh/Brittonic) branch rather than purely Gaelic.
* **Tone:** Should reflect the "modern" (1875) consensus overturning the older Pinkerton theory.

### 5. The Tonal Nuance Test (Ossian & Macpherson)
**Query:**
> "What is Keltie's verdict on the authenticity of the Poems of Ossian translated by James Macpherson? Does he consider them total forgeries?"

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**
* **Verdict:** Must **NOT** label them as total forgeries.
* **Nuance:** Must argue that while Macpherson may have arranged them, the "names," "spirit," and "incidents" were based on genuine ancient oral tradition.
* **Evidence:** Must cite the **topography** of the Highlands (places named after Fingal/Ossian) as proof of authenticity.
* **Sentiment:** Must capture the author's defense against "national prejudice" (anti-Scottish sentiment).

### 6. The "Silent" Constraint Test (The Sobieski Stuarts)
**Query:**
> "Does the text reference the *Vestiarium Scoticum* or the works of the Sobieski Stuarts regarding clan tartans? How does Keltie treat their authority?"

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**
* **Detection:** Must identify references to the "Sobieski Stuarts" and their claims.
* **Skepticism:** Must interpret the word **"pretensions"** to indicate Keltie doubts their authority.
* **Negative Constraint:** Must **NOT** mention the book title *Vestiarium Scoticum* unless it is explicitly in the retrieved chunk (which, in your test, it was not).
